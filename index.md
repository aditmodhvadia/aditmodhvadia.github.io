- ecg signals from smartwatch are passed to a _siamese network_ hosted on <span style="color: #ff9900">aws</span>.
- the network converts the ecg signals to frequency spectrogram and verifies the user.
- ecg is unique for an individual and is very promising for this task.

### object detection in satellite images [[code](https://github.com/amanbasu/ship-detection)]

<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/amanbasu/ship-detection?color=0088ff"/> <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/forks/amanbasu/ship-detection?color=ff8800"/> <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/amanbasu/ship-detection?color=00ff00"/>

- a deep network to detect ships in oceans from real-time satellite images using _yolov3_.
- trained a customized model on _darknet_ and hosted it on <span style="color: #ff9900">aws</span> to download the latest satellite images from _planet labs_, make predictions, & send the detected object coordinates to the user.

- our enhanced v-net model outperformed the results of the baseline in the _promise12_ challenge.
- the model was enhanced by tweaking its architecture, adding dilation, and deep supervision. we improved the accuracy by 6%.

### predicting the dynamics of tokamak discharge [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06230)] <br> (department of atomic energy, india)

- the aim of the project was to anticipate the phenomenon of major disruption in plasma confinement for _aditya tokamak_.
- we were able to anticipate the disruption of plasma 12 ms prior to the actual disruption (4 ms earlier than the state-of-the-art models).
- input features included the readings of various diagnostics like plasma current, mirnov oscillations, loop voltage, bolo meter readings, and many other.

### speech emotion recognition [[code](https://github.com/amanbasu/speech-emotion-recognition)]

<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/amanbasu/speech-emotion-recognition?color=0088ff"/> <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/forks/amanbasu/speech-emotion-recognition?color=ff8800"/> <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/amanbasu/speech-emotion-recognition?color=00ff00"/> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/tensorflow-1.10.0-green?logo=tensorflow"/> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6+-ee0044?logo=python"/>

- prediction of human emotions from raw audio using _iemocap_ database.
- bidirectional lstm was used along with local attention mechanism to focus on the part of speech which influence the emotion more.
- the architecture was trained on <span style="color: #76b900">nvidia</span> k80 system and gave results comparable to the state-of-the-art models.

### autonomous car [[code](https://github.com/amanbasu/autonomous-car-prototype)] [[paper](https://amanagarwal.io/files/autocar.pdf)]

- a self-driving rc car that can maneuver itself on an indoor, hand-made track.
- convolutional neural network was used to classify the direction of car from dashcam images.
- the model was deployed on raspberry pi for real-time predictions.
