## Projects

### Using ECG for Biometric Authentication [[code](https://github.com/amanbasu/ECG-Authentication)] [[blog](https://medium.com/intel-software-innovators/ecg-to-identify-individuals-from-data-to-deployment-74cce404f9f0)]
- ECG signals from smartwatch are passed to an algorithm hosted on web.
- The algorithm converts the ECG signals to frequency spectrogram and verifies the user by a siamese network.
- ECG is unique for an individual and is promising for this task.

### 3D Prostate Segmentation of MR Images using FCNN [[code](https://github.com/amanbasu/3d-prostate-segmentation)] [[pdf](https://just-amans-stuff.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/agarwalDilated21.pdf)]
- Our enhanced V-Net model outperformed the results of the baseline V-Net in PROMISE12 challenge.
- The model was enhanced by tweaking its architecture, adding dilation and deep supervision. We improved the accuracy by 6% points.

### Predicting the dynamics of Tokamak discharge [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06230)] <br> (Department of Atomic Energy, India)
- The aim of the project was to anticipate the phenomenon of Disruption during Plasma confinement inside ADITYA Tokamak.
- We were able to anticipate the disruption of plasma 12ms prior to the actual disruption (4ms earlier than the state-of-the-art models).
- Input features included the readings of various diagnostics like plasma current, mirnov oscillations, loop voltage, bolo meter readings, and many other.

### AmSat: A holistic system to classify temporal satellite imagery [[poster](https://github.com/amanbasu/amanbasu/blob/master/satellite_image_classification.pdf)]
- An algorithm to detect the construction activity from temporal satellite images.
- Temporal images were taken from Planet satellite and a labeled dataset for classification was prepared.
- A customized I3D Inception network (3DCNN) was trained on just 24 samples, giving accuracy of 85% on a test set of 21 samples.

### Speech Emotion Recognition [[code](https://github.com/amanbasu/speech-emotion-recognition)]
- Prediction of human emotions from raw audio using IEMOCAP database.
- Bidirectional LSTM was used along with local attention mechanism to focus on the part of speech which influence the emotion more.
- The architecture was trained on NVIDIA K80 system and gave results comparable to the state-of-the-art models.

### Autonomous Car [[code](https://github.com/amanbasu/Autonomous-Car-Prototype)] [[paper](https://amanagarwal.io/files/autoCar.pdf)]
- A self-driving RC car that can maneuver itself on an indoor, hand-made track.
- Convolutional Neural Network was used to classify the direction of car from dashcam images.
- The model was deployed on Raspberry Pi for real-time predictions.

### Analysis of crop health
- Detection of crop species and diseases using image data.
- Predicting the severity of disease using the image along with other parameters like soil, weather, region etc.
- Trained the network using a modified loss function, taking two classes into account, specie and disease.
